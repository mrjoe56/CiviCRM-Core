## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: Fix line-item total calculation ([dev/financial#182](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/-/issues/182): [#21212](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21212))**

  The total may sometimes incorrectly include tax-amount. This did not impact contributions through core forms but could impact customizations/add-ons that add taxed items via API.
